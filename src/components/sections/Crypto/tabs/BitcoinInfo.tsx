			<SectionTitle level='h2'>The History and Vision of Bitcoin</SectionTitle>

			<p className='mb-4 text-gray-600'>
				Bitcoin was created in 2008 by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. It was introduced as a peer-to-peer electronic cash
				system that would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.
			</p>

			<SectionTitle level='h4'>The Genesis</SectionTitle>

			<p className='mb-4 text-gray-600'>
				The Bitcoin whitepaper, titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System," was published on October 31, 2008. The first Bitcoin block,
				known as the Genesis Block, was mined on January 3, 2009, containing the famous message: "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second
				bailout for banks."
			</p>

			<SectionTitle level='h4'>Core Principles</SectionTitle>

			<ul className='list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-6 text-gray-600'>
				<li>
					<strong>Decentralization:</strong> No central authority controls Bitcoin. It operates on a distributed network of computers (nodes).
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Transparency:</strong> All transactions are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Immutability:</strong> Once confirmed, transactions cannot be reversed or altered.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Limited Supply:</strong> Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist, making it a deflationary asset.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Pseudonymity:</strong> Users can transact without revealing their real identities.
				</li>
			</ul>
