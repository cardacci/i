				About Me as a DJ
			</SectionTitle>

			<p className='mb-4'>
				I am a DJ passionate about <strong>progressive house</strong> and <strong>organic house</strong>, genres that allow me to create sets with
				depth, melody, and atmosphere. I love taking the dancefloor on a progressive musical journey, with smooth transitions and an immersive sonic
				narrative.
			</p>

			<p className='mb-4'>
				I also enjoy experimenting and having fun mixing <strong>deep house</strong>, <strong>house</strong>, and <strong>afro house</strong>â€”styles
				that bring groove, energy, and fresh rhythms to my sessions. This variety lets me adapt to different environments and audiences, always
				maintaining my own musical identity.
